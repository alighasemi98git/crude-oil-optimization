# Crude Oil Optimization

This project addresses a **nonlinear optimization problem** faced by the petrochemical company *Oljeblandarna* in planning the production and refining of crude oil over a three-week period. The objective is to **maximize expected profit** by optimizing crude oil purchases, conversions, storage, and sales under uncertainty and nonlinear effects.

## Project Overview

* **Problem Type:** Applied nonlinear programming (NLP)
* **Context:** Production planning in the petrochemical industry
* **Planning Horizon:** 3 weeks
* **Key Features:**

  * Stochastic crude oil supply modeled via a normal distribution
  * Nonlinear storage losses for intermediate products
  * Deterministic and advanced nonlinear formulations
  * Implementation and solution using **GAMS**

## Models

1. **Basic NLP Model**

   * Incorporates uncertainty in crude oil supply
   * Results in globally optimal solutions due to concavity of the objective function

2. **Advanced NLP Model**

   * Extends the basic model with nonlinear storage decay
   * Introduces nonconvexities, requiring global solvers or relaxation techniques for guaranteed optimality

## Results

* **Basic Model Profit:** ~294,835 kr
* **Advanced Model Profit:** ~292,266 kr
* Product A is consistently sold at its maximum weekly cap due to profitability
* Product B requires dynamic handling through storage, reconversion, and sales

## Key Insights

* Increasing the sales cap for Product A, particularly in Week 1, significantly boosts profit
* The advanced model provides a more realistic but slightly less profitable strategy due to storage decay
* Sensitivity analysis of constraints highlights potential operational improvements
